# MERN User Management System

## Overview

The **User Management System** is a web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It provides users with the ability to register, log in, view and edit their profiles, and search for other users. This project serves as a full-stack example of building a modern web application with user authentication and profile management.

## Features

- **User Registration and Login**: Users can create an account and log in to access their profile.
- **Profile Management**: Authenticated users can view and update their profile details, including their name, email, and bio.
- **User Directory**: A searchable list of all users allows users to view profiles of other users.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **JWT-Based Authentication**: Secure user authentication and session management.

## Technologies

- **Front-End**: 
  - **React** with **TypeScript** for building the user interface.
  - **Redux** or **Context API** for state management.
  - **TailwindCSS** or **Bootstrap** for styling and responsive design.
- **Back-End**:
  - **Node.js** and **Express.js** for creating the REST API.
  - **MongoDB** for database management.
  - **Mongoose** for MongoDB object modeling.
  - **JWT** for secure authentication.
- **Deployment**:
  - **Vercel** for deploying the front-end React application.
  - **Heroku** or **Render** for deploying the back-end server.
